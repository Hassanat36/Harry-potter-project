## Introduction

My journey into the world of parental leave policies, driven by data and brought to life with Power BI Desktop, has unveiled critical findings that illuminate the current landscape. Drawing from a comprehensive survey of 1,601 companies spanning 186 industries, I've transformed this data into a captivating visual narrative.

-	Data Analysis Expression (DAX).
- Data Visualization.

   ## Data Sourcing

   Data was gotten from Kaggle. [Click here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/things-we-do-for-family-some-bald-guy) 

   ## Data Transformation
 1. I imported my dataset to Power Query by using the format connector in PowerBI.
 2. I created new measures
    - Total Runtime = SUM(Movies[Runtime])
    - Total place = SUM(Places[Place ID])
    - count place = COUNT(Places[Place Category])

   ## Tools
- Excel for data cleaning
- PowerBI for creating analysis
