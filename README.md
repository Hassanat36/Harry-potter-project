## Skills Demonstrated

-	Extract Transform and Load (ETL).
-	Data Analysis Expression (DAX).
- Data Visualization.

   ## Data Sourcing

   Data was from kagle [click here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maricinnamon/harry-potter-movies-dataset)

   ## Data Transformation
 1. I imported my dataset to Power Query by using the format connector in PowerBI.
 2. I created new measures
    - Total Runtime = SUM(Movies[Runtime])
    - Total place = SUM(Places[Place ID])
    - count place = COUNT(Places[Place Category])

   ## Tools
- Excel for data cleaning
- PowerBI for creating analysis
